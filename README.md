# makemore-language-model
a language model that create names. inspired by Andrej Karpathy

The model get enhanced as per the following implimentations 
1. Biagram - basic probability based model 
    - implemented in the [Language_Models]_makemore.ipynb
2. MLP: [A Neural Probabilistic Language Model](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf)
    - implemented in the [Language_Models]_makemore_MLP.ipynb
